# Meta-prompt: 

Read this doc and do the last task. Update the task with what you are doing / did as part of the task completion criteria. Append only to this doc, I might remove stuff eventually. As part of your plan-making process you should write your plan steps in this doc as your "Implementation Plan" section. Add sections as needed to your solution. Your goal is to tersely give feedback on what was needed for the project success so that future Cline Dev sessions are more efficient by reading this doc. This is your journal.

# Task 1: Getting to know the infrastructure

A simple task to understand the project structure by implementing a basic API endpoint that returns the value 42. This involved creating a Pydantic model, adding a FastAPI endpoint, updating the TypeScript API client, and displaying the value in the React frontend. The task demonstrated the project's type-safe communication between frontend and backend using automatic TypeScript type generation from Pydantic models.

For detailed implementation steps and code examples, see [task1_infrastructure.md](task1_infrastructure.md).

# Task 2: User sessions

Implemented a token-based session system that assigns users to game rooms, either creating a new room or joining an existing waiting room. The forty-two endpoint was modified to return 42 only with a valid token, otherwise 43. The implementation used base64-encoded JSON tokens (non-secret as specified) and included both backend session management and frontend integration.

The backend was restructured for better modularity, with separate files for different concerns and a dedicated session management module. The frontend was updated to handle token storage, automatic inclusion in requests, and UI components for session management.

For detailed implementation steps, code structure, and lessons learned, see [task2_user_sessions.md](task2_user_sessions.md).

# Task 3: Cline context improvement

## Prompt

The above tasks are too verbose. Split them to their own files and then put clean summaries that are just a paragraph or two explaining that the files should be read if additional context is needed. This task is thus to edit this document, which is an unusual exception; usually you would do append-only for this context doc.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create separate markdown files for Task 1 and Task 2
2. Extract all detailed content from the main document to these files
3. Replace the detailed content with concise summaries (1-2 paragraphs)
4. Add references to the new files for additional context

## Implementation Status

Task 3 has been completed. The verbose task descriptions have been moved to separate files:
- Task 1 details moved to [task1_infrastructure.md](task1_infrastructure.md)
- Task 2 details moved to [task2_user_sessions.md](task2_user_sessions.md)

The main CLINE_CONTEXT.md file now contains concise summaries of each task with links to the detailed files. This improves readability while preserving all the implementation details for reference when needed.

This approach makes the context document more manageable and focused, while still providing access to all the detailed information through the linked files. Future tasks can follow this pattern, keeping the main document concise with links to detailed implementation files.

# Task 4: Get MNIST image API

Implementing an API to fetch MNIST images for a digit identification game. This involves downloading the MNIST dataset at server start and serving random images from the dataset via an API endpoint. The dataset will be stored in server resources with appropriate gitignore settings to avoid redownloading on every server start.

For detailed implementation steps and code examples, see [task4_mnist_image_api.md](task4_mnist_image_api.md).

## Implementation Status

Task 4 has been completed. The MNIST image API has been implemented with the following features:

1. Created a modular MNIST dataset handling system that:
   - Downloads the dataset only once and stores it in a server resources directory
   - Loads the dataset into memory when needed
   - Provides functions to get random images with optional labels

2. Added a new API endpoint (/api/mnist/image) that:
   - Serves random MNIST images from the dataset
   - Validates user sessions using tokens
   - Allows optionally including the actual digit label

3. Updated the .gitignore file to exclude the MNIST dataset files while preserving the directory structure.

This implementation provides a clean, efficient way to serve MNIST images for the digit identification game, with proper separation of concerns and type safety throughout the API.
